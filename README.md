# StockY - A sneaker trading platform 



The creation of StockY as a republicate of Stock X, the fashion resale plateform, is a coding attempt to create a similar bidding mechanism with the MEN stack frame work. Users can sell and buy by putting in a ask and bid price to join the queue respectively. If the sell/buy item does not exist in the database, users can creat a new product page for selling or request the product from potential sellers. 

Technologies Used:
- MongoDB
- Express framework
- Node
- Javascript 
- CSS
- HTML
- Heroku (free deployment expired, seeking new flatform to deploy)
